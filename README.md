## I am neither an excellent engineer nor a talented developer.##

I have worked as an engineer until now.

That does not mean that I am good at my job because I am skilled or have some ability.

However, as I have been working in IT for a long time, I have lived with worries and concerns about what is necessary and how long I can continue working as an engineer.

### I am going to start studying development a little bit before it is too late, before my mind becomes too rigid. ###

That does not mean that I hope to get a job somewhere or change jobs to become a developer with this experience.

I am just writing a journal because I want to leave a small footprint as a person and live a long life in this era in which I live.

And I will start by referring to the "Kkangsam's Lecture Channel" among the YouTube channels. 

The content is very poor and there is not much, but I will try my best.
